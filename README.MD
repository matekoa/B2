# ML Lab 2: Artificial Neural Network From Scratch
In this assignment you will be building and training feedforward neural network from scratch using numpy. The aim is to have a better understanding of how the backpropagation algorithm works, rather than use libraries that do all the hard work for you. 

The primary objective is to train a neural network to classify Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of military vehicles. Hopefully this is an interesting departure from the usual MNIST/CIFAR datasets that you will likely come across.

In this case there are certainly better architectures to use, but we are not too concerned with achieving optimal results for this assignment.
